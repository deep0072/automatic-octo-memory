This is simple CRM web app.
that is fully based on Django frame work.
what is Django framework?
well it is web development framework that is based on python language.

well what is its working? django framework works on MVT.
where M is modal, V = views, T= template

MOdel is just used to create our database without using any sql query. yeah you are seeing clearly withou using of any sql. 
Django in backend perform all sql based command automatically. so it is pretty handy

now view is used to collect those information of model. means it is used to perform all crud operation. it is also take user input and connect to models and vice versa.

now templates are used to render all infromation are provide by View at the front. in this we can use css. html, javascript. 

So django is fully fledged web development framework.
